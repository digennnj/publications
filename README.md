## Intuitive Model Transformations: A Guided Framework for Structural Modeling
As research in Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) continues to innovate the software engineering process, a gap has been created between its potential benefit and actual use. This gap exists due to MDSE education being held back by tools that are not well-suited for learning and use by beginners. To teach new developers MDSE concepts before moving into industrial tools, MDSE educators need a lightweight, model-first, end-to-end teaching tool. The Instructional Modeling Language (IML) is proposed as a solution to fit these needs. This thesis implements for the IML Framework one of the foundational aspects of MDSE: Model Transformations. The ability to apply model transformations to large collections of models contributes to software reuse, allowing developers to dedicate efforts elsewhere. Furthermore, the early work of conceptually modeling systems has a larger payoff as a result of model transformations being used in the code generation process. These benefits are some of the most influential factors for adopting MDSE and must be properly emphasized in education. Model transformations in IML provide students with a guided experience and clear explanations of the model transformation processes. In turn, students are provided with a solid foundation in MDSE and its benefits.

## SuMo: A Supportive Modeling Language Environment for Guided Model Transformations
Adoption of model-driven software engineering is limited by the steep mastery curve of leading approaches and their associated technologies. To help combat this, we research and develop a supportive modeling language and environment, SuMo, that ensures modelers are able to produce valid models, model transformations, and generated artifacts in their development projects. SuMo includes a custom modeling language definition, a structure-and semantic-enforcing live modeling environment to support model creation, a transparent code generation engine that includes model element mapping to better integrate modeling and programming languages, and a guided model-to-model transformation engine to help users through the complex task of transformation specification. Each of these guided approaches to model design and transformation development are included in a single, web-based, environment to avoid complex configurations, which often cause issues for novice developers. We conduct a systematic evaluation that assesses SuMoâ€™s code generation and model-to-model transformation processes independently. We conclude that both types of model transformations developed using SuMo produce valid and correct outputs in all cases.
